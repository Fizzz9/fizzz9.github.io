# Zehao Zhang — Academic Portfolio (Demo)

This is a **static, al-folio style** academic website template ready for GitHub Pages.
No Ruby/Jekyll required. Upload and go.

## Deploy (first time)
1. Create a public repo named **fizzz9.github.io** in your GitHub account.
2. Upload **all files** from this folder to the repo (root).
3. In *Settings → Pages*, set Source = `Deploy from a branch`, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/ (root)`. Save.
4. Visit `https://fizzz9.github.io` after 1–2 minutes.

## Customize
- Home hero & sections: `index.html`
- About/Projects/Contact/Blog: `/pages/*.html`
- Images: `/assets/img/` (replace `proj1.svg`, etc. or upload your own files)
- Styles/animations: `/assets/css/style.css`
- Scripts: `/assets/js/main.js`
- Favicon: `/assets/img/favicon.svg`

## Tips
- Replace demo text with your real bio and project details.
- Add your headshot to `/assets/img/profile.jpg` and reference it on About page.
- Add more project cards by copying the `<article class="card">...</article>` block.
- We can switch to a full Jekyll al-folio later if needed.
